									<h2>Welcome to Project STEMreach!</h2>
								<p>In February of 2018, Project STEMReach was founded by Abhishek Vinchure and Prothit Halder (Seniors at Evergreen Valley High School). We launched with the mission of providing free STEM education in low-income neighborhoods, combining both of our interests in science and coding. At first, we were a small group of friends with a shared love for teaching children. Our first location was at Dr. Martin Luther King Library, where we held summer coding and science sessions. For science, we’ve touched on a broad range of topics, from the engineering design process to the scientific method. For coding, we focused on the Python programming language. During this time, we also had another coding session at the Alum Rock Library. Rather than simply teaching the material, we bring unique lessons that heavily emphasize a discussion-based learning approach. Each student is able to learn, all the while enjoying the experience. These sessions were heavily praised, both by the parents and students.It’s safe to say that we’ve left a lasting impact on the community. Overall, we’ve taught around 100 children, and the number keeps rising with every new session. After every session, we’d see their faces light up in joy at what they’d learned in the past hour. Seeing how much the kids enjoyed the sessions inspired us to continue and expand to more locations. So, we partnered with the Boys & Girls Clubhouses of Silicon Valley to bring weekly science sessions. 

As the months passed, we attracted interest from students from around San Jose, who were all interested in valuable leadership and community service experience. Our organization grows by the day, as we enable other high schoolers to be leaders. We’ve grown from an organization of just 5 close friends to one spanning the city of San Jose. 2018 was a successful year for Project STEMReach. We’re excited to see what 2019 has in store for us.

 </p><h2>The Problem</h2>
								<p>Only 19% of 8th graders from a low-income families score 
									"Proficient" in basic math, compared to the 47% from higher
									income families. STEM is a path that anyone can follow and anyone can become interested in, but sometimes
									it is restricted to only those who can afford the education. Currently, we need to do more so everyone has equal access to a STEM program.  
				
									 
								<h3> The Plan </h3>
								<p><h4>Volunteering:</h4>  We want you to have a direct impact on the community. Recently, we wrapped up our summer sessions at King Library. Over the school year, we’ll be hosting science and coding classes and King Library, as well as the Boys and Girls club. You’re able to volunteer to teach coding and/or science to kids aged 9-12. More info on these opportunities will be at the first meeting!   

							<h4> STEM Awareness Campaigns: </h4> We want to spread the issue that plagues low-income communities: lack of STEM access to disadvantaged youth. Also, we want to educate the EVHS community about the importance of STEM in today’s society. So, we’ll host multiple informational campaigns (fliers, STEM spirit day, etc). Interested in art, writing, public speaking? You can run an awareness campaign! 

							<h4> School Drives: </h4> Throughout the year, we’ll work with other organizations to provide school essentials (calculators, backpacks, pencils, etc) to those in need. You have the opportunity to help host these drives within the community, and get participation from others. We’ll also fundraise to donate to organizations like the Boys and Girls Club.
