								<h2>The Problem</h2>
								<p>Only 19% of 8th graders from a low-income families score 
									"Proficient" in basic math, compared to the 47% from higher
									income families. STEM is a path that anyone can follow and anyone can become interested in, but sometimes
									it is restricted to only those who can afford the education. Currently, we need to do more so everyone has equal access to a STEM program.  
				
									 </p> 
									<h2>Welcome to Project STEMreach!</h2>
								<p>
									We're a progressive organization of bright students within the San Jose community with the same goal: empowering the next generation. 

Together, we'll bring STEM to low-income neighborhoods through free classes for kids, awareness campaigns, drives, fundraisers and so much more! 
 </p>
								<h3> The Plan </h3>
								<p><h4>Volunteering:</h4> We want you to have a direct impact on the community. Recently, we wrapped up our summer sessions at King Library. Over the school year, we’ll be hosting science and coding classes and King Library, as well as the Boys and Girls club. You’re able to volunteer to teach coding and/or science to kids aged 9-12. More info on these opportunities will be at the first meeting!  

STEM Awareness Campaigns: We want to spread the issue that plagues low-income communities: lack of STEM access to disadvantaged youth. Also, we want to educate the EVHS community about the importance of STEM in today’s society. So, we’ll host multiple informational campaigns (fliers, STEM spirit day, etc). Interested in art, writing, public speaking? You can run an awareness campaign! 

School Drives: Throughout the year, we’ll work with other organizations to provide school essentials (calculators, backpacks, pencils, etc) to those in need. You have the opportunity to help host these drives within the community, and get participation from others. We’ll also fundraise to donate to organizations like the Boys and Girls Club.
